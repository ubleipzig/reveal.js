## local authoring
In order to view your slides while creating them you can simply open the html-page in your browser.
However, some features i.e. side notes and pdf-creation only work when requested via http. For this
purpose you can use docker to start a container that is serving the slides as a webserver.

* first install depending node modules
```bash
#$ docker-compose run --rm node npm install
```
* then start the service
```bash
#$ docker-compose up
```

It also compiles your css if you choose to create a custom theme. If you just want to compile the css
prior to committing your changes use

```bash
#$ docker-compose run --rm node npm run compile-css
```

## local copy
If you want to use the slides offline you can just open the html-page which is the entrypoint for your slides
locally in your browser.
